Cell phones, tablets, clothes, books, electronic objects, for instance, and many more. So a user wants to buy something through this GUI-based automated framework, then just a click away from a mouse to buy these items.
                        </p>
                        <p>This application's main goal is to make it interactive and simple to use. It will make a product easier to browse, access and pick. It provides users with a sophisticated search engine to search for items that are unique to their needs. The search engine offers a simple and efficient way of searching for products where a user can interactively search for a product and optimize the products available on the basis of the feedback of the user.</p>
